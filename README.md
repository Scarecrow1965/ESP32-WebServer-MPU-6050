This program will allow the ESP32, MPU6050, OLED SSD 1306 to display the MPU data not only on the OLED Screen but also onto a local host webpage.

The data folder and its contents will provide the rudimentary webpage to display the MPU-6050's data visually.
the main.cpp file is the heart of the program but since I built it with a few Arduino libraries while using PlatformIO to compile the program and gather all the libraries and send it to the ESP32
